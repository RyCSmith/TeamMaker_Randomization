# TeamMaker_Randomization
Overview: Uses randomized algorithm to produce solution of exponential problem of unique team pairings in reasonable time.

Design: All implementation by Ryan Smith.

Use: Run from TeamMaker.scala in the command line. User is prompted for size of class and number of assignments. Program produces unique sets of pairs for each assignments such that no two students work together more than once. Program uses intelligent randomization to produce an answer to exponential problem in reasonable time.
